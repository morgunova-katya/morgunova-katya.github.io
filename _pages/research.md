This are some of the projects I have worked on together with the relevant papers, handouts and presentations. For the full bibliography see my CV.

<h3> Complementizer-trace effect in Russian </h3>

I conducted an experimental study to see whether Russian really exhibits complementizer trace effect and explore what it might mean for the theory of the phenomenon in general. 

<h3> Dative-infinitive construction in Russian </h3>

I look at different syntactic and semantic properties of dative-infinitves constructions in Russian (similar to English John is to finish his breakfast), such as covert modality, the internal structure of the construction and the nature of subject's dative case. (Un)fortunately, only availaible in Russian right now. 

<h3> A'-dependencies and island constraints in Russian </h3>

I look into whether various island structure are similarly sensitive to different types of A-bar extractions. Turns out, there are certain cool puzzles in this area. I also explore the nature of asymmetry in different types of A'-movements using experimental methods.

<h3> Correlatives and wh-indefinites in Balkar (joint work with Ilya Naumov) </h3>

<h3> Ellipsis in Buryat </h3>

I studied sluicing and verbal anaphors in Buryat. 

<h3> Fragment answers in Russian </h3>

I describe the properties of Russian fragment answers and explore what can they tell us about fragment answers generation.
