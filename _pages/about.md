My name is Katya (Ekaterina in official documents). I am a second year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at McGill University. I got my BA and MA degrees in linguistics from Moscow State University. 

My research focuses on syntax, syntax-semantics interface and fieldwork. The languages I am currently working on the most are Kirundi, Kanien'k√©ha (Mohawk) and Greek. I am a member of the <a href="https://mull-lab.org/">Montreal Understudied Languages Linguistics Lab (MULL-Lab)</a>. In my past projects I focused on a number of puzzles in Russian syntax, as well as working on indigenous languages of Russia, including Hill Mary, Buryat and Balkar. 

I am from a Russian city Ulyanovsk. Vladimir Lenin was born there and it also has a beautiful view of the Volga River. Aside from linguistics, I like watching films, swimming and biking.
