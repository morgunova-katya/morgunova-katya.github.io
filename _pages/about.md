My name is Katya (Ekaterina in official documents). I am a Ph.D. student at McGill. My research focuses on syntax and syntax-semantics interface. I also do fieldwork and experimental research. I got my BA and MA degrees in linguistics from Moscow State University. 

I am from a Russian city Ulyanovsk. Lenin was born there and it also has a cool view of the Volga River. Aside from linguistics, I like watching films (check out my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/simbir/">letterboxd</a>), swimming, biking and drinking fancily brewed coffee.
