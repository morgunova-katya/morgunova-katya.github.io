My name is Katya (Ekaterina in official documents). I am a first year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at McGill University. I got my BA and MA degrees in linguistics from Moscow State University. 

My research focuses on syntax and syntax-semantics interface. I also do fieldwork and experimental research. My most recent projects concern a number of puzzles in Russian, including A'-movement, islands, complementizer-trace effect, covert modality and syntax of modal predicates.

I am from a Russian city Ulyanovsk. Vladimir Lenin was born there and it also has a beautiful view of the Volga River. Aside from linguistics, I like watching films (check out my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/simbir/">letterboxd</a>), swimming and biking.
